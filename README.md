# Sound

## Introduction

Sound contains a collection of tools for working with:

- IPA symbols
- phonemes
- features
- stress

in Haskell.
I'm using this library for computer generated poetry.

## Uses

- convert IPA symbols into sounds using Sound.GenAm.IPA
- represent sounds as sets of phonological features using Sound.Feature
- automatically syllabify words using Sound.Syllabify
- measure rhyme, assonance, alliteration (including approximate measures) using
  Sound.Rhyme

## Types

Documentation can be generated using haddock.
