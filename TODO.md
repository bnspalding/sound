# TODO

- write a note on phones vs phonemes, phonemic vs phonetic transcription

- write tests to ensure that new GenAm sound definitions match the feature
  descriptions in data/genam-consonants.csv

- revisit tests to specify new functions/interface for library

- update vowels with new definitions in src/Sound/GenAm/Sounds.hs

- the README needs significant revisions once new feature structure has settled

- add combining character for disegment symbol representations in phonemes
